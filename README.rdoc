ADD Gamerz site (www.addgamerz.com).  A learning(ish) blog/event planner to inform followers of upcoming events as well as any updates on vidoes we are creating.

The website also contains a tool for planning the annual 3/1 81's camping trip.  At the time of writing its more of just a list as to who is attending but I am researching tools for geocoding based on city/state and making a map view to not only show where the user is located, but a central location to everyone as sort of a suggestion to where to host the camping trip (Hoping for vegas)
